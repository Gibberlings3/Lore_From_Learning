      <p>The Lore From Learning mod is a small <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> mod that adds  lore bonuses to your main character as you learn and adventure throughout the game. The bonuses (and the stimuli that provide them) are, by design, meant to be minor and enhance the role-playing aspect of the game.</p>

      <p>The Lore From Learning mod is designed to work with the original or Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate or Baldur's Gate II, with or without their various expansions, and including nthe conversion projects BGT, EET, or Tutu. While the mod will not currently work for Icewind Dale, support is planned for future versions. </p>
      <p>In terms of installation order, Lore From Learning should generally be installed  after any NPC mods. The mod utilizes the main character's &quot;dream script&quot; (the script that triggers events at rest periods) which is also sometimes used by mods NPCs. By installing it after mod NPCs it ensures that the lore trigger/rewards will be weighted lower than romance or other NPC-related events. </p>
      <p>At present there are no known incompatibilities.</p>

      <p><strong>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG<br />
        </strong>Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the   additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the   tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must  run a program   called <a href="https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/71305/mod-dlc-merger-merge-steam-gog-sod-dlc-or-custom-dlcs-with-the-main-game">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation  before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod.</p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        The Lore From Learning mod for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-cdlore.exe</strong> and the folder <strong>cdlore</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-cdlore.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-cdlore.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>macOS</strong><br />
        The Lore From Learning mod for macOS is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-cdlore</strong>, <strong>setup-cdlore.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>cdlore</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-cdlore.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-cdlore.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        The Lore From Learning mod for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.</p>
      <p>Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run tolower   and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option   (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save   time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the   first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only   this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're   unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>
      <p>To install, run WeInstall cdlore in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-cdlore --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. . </p>

      <p>The Lore From Learning is broken down into more targeted components for the player. However, they all work on the same mechanic: at every rest, your main character will have some time to read books, talk with their party, etc. It is during these rest periods where lore  triggers will be evaluated and, if appropriate,  bonuses awarded. The specific details about triggers are deliberately vague so as not to spoil, however, full details are posted on the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/forum/28-miscellaneous-released-mods/">forum</a>, specifically in <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/32777-spoilers-mechanics-of-the-lore-from-learning-mod/">this thread</a> (spoilers). </p>
      <p><em>Advanced Customization</em><br />
        In the mod folder is a 
        text file named customize.tpa. Using a text editor, you can adjust various factors that affect the various triggers and rewards related to all of the mod's components. Details are in the file itself; if you have any questions or feedback feel free to ask on the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/forum/28-miscellaneous-released-mods/">forum</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>Books Provide Lore Bonuses </strong><br />
        As the player adventures through the Sword Coast and beyond they find many history books. As the player reads these books they can earn bonuses for learning the history of the broader world. A handful of books will provide greater bonuses than others. However, there is a maximum amount of lore you can earn from books. </p>
      <p><strong>Weapon Knowledge Provides Lore Bonuses </strong><br />
        As your skill with various weapons advanced, two lore bonuses are possible. </p>
      <p><strong>Party Members Provide Lore Bonuses</strong><br />
        Given how much time you spend with them, the party can be a wealth of information. This component provides some minor rewards for traveling, long-term, with a party with a diverse set of backgrounds, specifically, of many different race and class combinations. </p>
      <p><strong>Defeating Monsters Provides Lore Bonuses</strong><br />
        The player will gain lore knowledge as they adventure and defeat monsters. Specifically, lore bonuses can be earned by defeating many different types of monsters. </p>
      <p><strong>Exploring Areas Provides Lore Bonuses</strong><br />
        The player will gain lore knowledge as they adventure and explore new areas. In particular, famous or exotic locations (e.g. other planes) will provide larger advancement for lore bonuses. </p>

      <p>Lore From Learning was inspired by a suggestion from Cahir for a new Tweaks Anthology component. Cahir proposed that these otherwise good (but somewhat pointless) history books could actually do something in game, namely, provide a small lore bonus. I really liked the idea, but the more I thought about it I realized the idea could be expanded. After all lore is a relatively small mechanic that doesn't really affect game balance, but there were some minor opportunities to emphasize and reward role-playing. </p>
      <p>So while he's already  awesome (he's been a long-time Polish translator for  other G3 mods), I'd like to thank Cahir for the original inspiration for the mod. In addition, thanks to the folks on the Infinity Engine Discord that helped with the original discussion, namely auiwqi, Kenraali, and Lauriel. </p>
      <p>As of version 3, even more thanks to Cahir for the Polish translation! </p>
      <p>Thanks also to yota13 for the Russian translation added in version 4. </p>

      <p> The modding community for the Infinity Engine has been going strong for
        nearly two decades now, and is the culmination of thousands of unpaid modding
        hours by fellow fans of the game. Modders produce their best work and players
        get the best, well-supported mods when we all work together. </p>
      <p> There are two big ways to upset this harmony. One is to claim someone else's
        work as your own. The second is to host and redistribute a mod without permission
        from the author(s). </p>
      <p> Be kind to your fellow players and modders. Don't do either. </p>
